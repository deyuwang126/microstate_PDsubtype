1. Microstate window-based dynamic networks construction - MWNs_PLI.py
   load individual 26 channels EEG recordings, realign and segement the data to .seg file from CARTOOL, than construct networks using phase lag index
2. Derived spatial variability calculation 
   Defined formulas are .m file.
3. 3D-CNN model with a demo dataset - CNN_model.py
